# Computer-Graphics-Project

A simple village is a mini project in  computer graphics which  is simple, good looking and useful. 
We have mainly created some artifacts in this mini project, like a home, sun, clouds, trees, and birds. 
In the project a house is present in a  small village and in the sky couple of clouds will be passing in 
the sky and there will be few trees from where the set of birds will be flying from and in the house we
 can turn off the light    and turn on the light whenever it is needed and it has got two modes in it day
mode and the night mode the  above-explained  things are attained in the day mode and in the night
mode an airplane and the comet will be  passing in the  night sky. This is an overview of the project. 
In this  project we   have  implemented  an “simple village” so we have given the title as “SIMPLE 
VILLAGE” where  a small house will  be  present  and around  it some trees will be there and in the 
sky, a couple of clouds  will be kept on moving in the  sky and the sun will be there. From the trees 
some birds will fly towards   the sky we have designed a set  of birds and we made them fly one set 
after the other to show the motion of some objects and also we have provided motion for the clouds 
too. Inside the house, we can turn on the light   and turn off the light by the controls provided in the 
keyboard. There is a night mode in which there will be the dark sky and comets will be moving and 
the airplane these two objects will appear when the respective control is pressed on the keyboard and 
the mouse.
